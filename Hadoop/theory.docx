# Hadoop developed in Java since 2005 (Doug cutting + Mike -> Yahoo -> 2006 Apache soft. foundations)

==< Apache Based Opensource Framework that allow to Store & Process of Big Data set in a Parallel & Distributed manner

# Main Components::
    => HDFS (Hadoop Distribution File System) 
        -> store & manage huge data in efficient manner using *Distributed Storage* (by default 128MB file partition)
        -> which data where store that all are save in *Master Node* by "meta data"
        -> also use Replication method === if any failure problem fatch so use duplicate files

    => MapReduce
        -> Distributed & Parallel Processing Technique for Process data
        -> ip/op both are in list key:value pair formate
